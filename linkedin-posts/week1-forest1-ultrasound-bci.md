# 🚀 Week 1 – How I’m Turning My No Internship Summer Into a Neurotech Deep Dive

I didn’t land a summer internship. So I created something better: a personal research series where I explore the most exciting innovations in neurotechnology one week at a time.

---

### 🧠 This Week’s Discovery:
**Forest 1**  a brain computer interface (BCI) that uses **focused ultrasound** instead of wires, metal, or meds.

It’s currently being tested in the UK and is the **first mental health–focused BCI supported by a national health system**.

---

### 🔍 Why Forest 1 is Disruptive:

- 🧠 Built for **mood disorders** like depression, OCD, and addiction  
- 📡 **Completely wireless**  no electrodes, no external batteries  
- 🧭 Combines **real time brain mapping** with **precise modulation**  
- 📍 Clinical trial began in **March 2025**, running for **3.5 years**  
- 🇬🇧 Backed by the **UK NHS** and **ARIA’s £69M Precision Neurotechnologies Programme**

---

### 🧪 Led by a Remarkable Team:

- Dr. Aimun Jamjoom  
- Dr. Elsa Fouragnan  
- Dr. Jacques Carolan  
- Dr. Sumner L. Norman  

Their work is paving the way for a future where **psychiatric conditions are treated at the circuit level**.

This journey is just beginning, but I’m excited to keep learning and sharing what I find each week. 🌱  
Stay tuned for more neurotech deep dives.
